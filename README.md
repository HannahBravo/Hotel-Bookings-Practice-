# Hotel-Bookings-Practice-

This is an activity that I completed in RStudio for the Google Data Analytics Certificate.

The activity included importing a .csv file of hotel booking information, viewing samples and attributes of the data to become 
familiar with it. Cleaning and organizing the data, although it didn't seem like an extensive example of cleaning data.
Calculating some summary statistics, and then finally creating a couple of graphics to answer questions.
